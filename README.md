# Transliteration Service

## Overview
The Transliteration Service is a project aimed at managing directories and files with Unicode English text that have corresponding equivalents in Devanagari text. 
Changes made to a file or directory in one script (English or Devanagari) are seamlessly propagated to its counterpart, ensuring synchronization between the two representations.

## Features
- **Directory and File Synchronization**: Automatically mirrors changes between English and Devanagari text files and directories.
- **Unicode Support**: Handles Unicode text to ensure accurate representation and conversion between scripts.
- **Bidirectional Updates**: Supports updates from either English to Devanagari or vice versa.

## Use Cases
- Managing bilingual file systems for better accessibility and usability.
- Use in applications requiring consistent script representation for linguistic or cultural reasons.
- Simplifying workflows for users working with both English and Devanagari scripts.

## How It Works
1. **File and Directory Parsing**: The service monitors directories and files for changes.
2. **Transliteration**: When a change is detected, it applies transliteration rules to synchronize the corresponding file or directory in the other script.
3. **Update Propagation**: Ensures that updates in one representation are reflected in the equivalent counterpart.
